# Did Russia win the 2016 US elections?

# Abstract
Social media platforms have taken a great importance in our modern society. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn have become very powerful tools to spread a message. They allow a direct connection between parties or companies and citizens, and recent events such as the Arab Spring have shown they can be used as a driving force. 
However, in such media which favor free expression, the control is weak or inexistant and thus fake information can spread quickly, against the social good.
In order to see the impact social media can have on important social questions, we chose the 3 Million Russian Troll Tweets dataset. This dataset contains tweets from the IRA (Internet Research Agency), which is a Russian company specialized in online propaganda to serve Russian interests. They notably  ran a sophisticated and coordinated campaign to interfere in the 2016 US elections, supposedly to advocate against the democrat candidate Hillary Clinton. Our aim here is to to analyze Russiaâ€™s interference in these elections. We first plan to analyze the characteristics of these tweets and the underlying intentions of the trolls, following which we will see the possible impact of the trolls on the election using a voter survey.


# Research questions
- What feelings are expressed by the tweets (mostly hatred)?
- What techniques are used to influence the reader's opinion?
- What are the most reccurent subjects?
- Was it really a campaign of disinformation? (relation to political scandals or polemics)
- Is there a correlation between this campaign and the voting intentions, and more generally an impact on the elections? (use of a voter survey)

# Dataset
- 3 Million Russian Troll Tweets
- Events of political scandals or polemics
- Voter survey from 2014 to 2016

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

### Up to the 16th of November (Data Acquisition , Data Preparation and Cleaning)

- Exploratory analysis of the 3 Million Russian Troll tweets
- Find a voter survey with different categories (age, sexe, etc.)
- Find the main politics-related events during the election
- Clean the tweets dataset (delete unwanted characters, take into account link inside the tweets, etc.)

### Up to the 25th of November (Data interpretation)

- Analyze the character (aggressive, disappointed, doubtful, misinformative?) of tweets with respect to categories (right troll, left troll, etc.)
- Analyze the timing of the tweets, if links to a particular events in order to disimform
- Try to find some correlations between tweets and a voter survey

# Questions for TAa
Should we rather focus on one particular subject?
