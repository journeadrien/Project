# Did Russia win the 2016 US elections?

# Abstract
Social media platforms have taken a great importance in our modern society. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn have become very powerful tools to spread a message. They allow a direct connection between parties or companies and citizens, and recent events such as the Arab Spring have shown they can be used as a driving force. 
However, in such media which favor free expression, the control is weak or inexistant and thus fake information can spread quickly, against the social good.
In order to see the impact social media can have on important social questions, we chose the 3 Million Russian Troll Tweets dataset. This dataset contains tweets from the IRA (Internet Research Agency), which is a Russian company specialized in online propaganda to serve Russian interests. They notably  ran a sophisticated and coordinated campaign to interfere in the 2016 US elections, supposedly to advocate against the democrat candidate Hillary Clinton. Our aim here is to to analyze Russiaâ€™s interference in these elections. We will use scandals that happened during the elctions to see how the trolls used them to manipulate public opinion and we will see the possible impact of the trolls on the election using a voter survey.


We selected seven major events which happened during the US elections. We hope to make a connection between these events and the tweets of the IRA to see how they reacted to these events and howe they tried to influence the public opinion.

# Main political scandals during the elections
## Hillary Clinton

1) Critisizing Trump's electorate: 09/09/2016
   During a talk, Hillary Clinton sparks controversy by suggesting half of Trump's electorate belongs to "a basket of deplorables". Trump uses this to draw sympathy and to depict Clinton as someone who doesn't respect all Americans.

2) Feeling unwell during commemoration ceremony: 11/09/2016
   During the commemoration ceremony, Hillary Clinton is forced to leave as she is not feeling well. She is diagnosed with pneumonia. Trump uses this as an argument that Hillary Clinton is not strong enough to govern the USA.

3) The Clinton emails: 28/10/2016
   On March 2nd 2015, the New York Times reveals that Hillary Clinton used a private server to access her emails when she was Secretary of State, but the investigation suggest that she was merely careless and no suit is filed. However, FBI director James Comey announces 11 days before the elections that new emails have been found and so that the case will be reopened. Donald Trump will use this affair to discredit the democrat candidate.

4) The pizzagate: 30/10/2016
   The pizzagate conspiracy theory originates from a tweet by a laywer from New York asserting that there exists a pedophilia network around John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's compaign director. This tweet quickly became viral, and the hashtag Pizzagate appeared on November 7th on twitter (one day before the elections).

## Donald Trump

1) Reaction to slain US army captain: 30/07/2016
   Trump held disrespectful word towards the father's of a US army captain who died in Irak in 2004. The public opinion reacted strongly to the interview and many Republicans attacked him for his behavior did not correspond to their values.

2) Controversy over tax returns: 01/10/2016
   On begininning of October, the New York Times reveals that Donald Trump may have declared in a doubtful way the bankruptcy of his casino, which may have led to him paying less taxes. Hillary Clinton attacked the republican on his responsability in this case.

3) 'Access Hollywood' tape: 07/10/2016
   The Washington Post published a tape from 2005 where Donald Trump describes how he attempted to seduce a woman. He holds sexist, and degrading comments about women. The action he formulates are described as sexual assault. This leads to the loss of the support from some of his voters.

# Research questions
- Is there a correlation between the content of the tweets and the main political events during the campaign?
- How did the trolls interfere in the public opinion?
- What is the impact on voting intentions?

# Datasets
- small Kaggle dataset
- large Twitter dataset: a larger dataset with tweets in many languages over a wider time range
- Voter survey from 2014 to 2016

# Cleaning
We performed cleaning on the dataset to select the timescale that is relevant to us. We will first focus on tweets written in English.
We selected the features which are relevant to us.
